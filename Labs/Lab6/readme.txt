1. What are some disadvantages of using multiple inheritance in this program?
    - Classes can be confusing
    - Constructors can be difficult to understand what is needed
    - The MRO can also be confusing
2. How would you implement this system without using multiple inheritance?
Describe the solution.
    - Each card would only implement from a card base
    - This would lead to a lot of code repeating because some methods can be
        be inherited instead of done again.
